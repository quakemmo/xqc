ABOUT
=====
Quake MMO is an attempt to add MMO-like features to Quake 3 Arena (Q3A).
It is a fork of Ioquake3, which is, in turn, a fork of Q3A.

The original Ioquake3 README.md has been moved to README-ioq3.md.


CODING STYLE
============
Legacy code retains whatever style it has.

New code:
Indentation is TABS, each TAB = 4 spaces.
As a rule of thumb, readability is more important than performance unless
150 FPS is being threatened.

Generally speaking, K&R / Linux kernel C coding style applies, with the following quirks:
	- Line length can go up to 125 chars if it seems like a good idea in a particular situation
	- Functions have the opening brace on the same line as the function name
	- Typedefs are welcome
